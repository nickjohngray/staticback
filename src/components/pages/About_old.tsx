            <h1>History</h1>
            Strength Pit Otara was born out of the passion to facilitate a safe place, tailored for Maori and Pasifika
            to be themselves, and grow their natural strength.
            <br></br>Coach Afaese Paea, born and bred in Otara, always had a interest in strength sports, powerlifting,
            martial arts and Rugby.
            <br></br>While browsing around the big boys toys one year he stumbled across a Strongman event at the Easter
            Show back in 2005 - 2006 and searched how to get involved in that sport.
            <p></p>
            And the rest is history, his first Novice competition he won without any training and then decided to pursue
            the NZ Strongman Arena.
            <br></br>Due to the events being few and far between it was difficult to train without the apparatusâ€™s so we
            decided to offer strength training to a local Box Empire Training Box based in Otara back in 2014 and the
            word got around and some 10 poly boys started showing up after the Box had closed.
            <br></br>Thanks to a really good mate also born and bred in Otara Lama Saga loaned us his space until we out
            grew it.
            <p></p>We set up officially in June 2015, and operate online coaching, strength and conditioning workshops
            all over the country and have Athletes competing in Strongman both in NZ and Australia.
