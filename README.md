EasyEcom (Static-Back) is an easy e-commerce solution


To get up and running just:

yarn

yarn start


Update the Manifest file and add other components as needed

This system uses React and React Static  ( that makes it lighting fast ) and Redux with TypeScript ( to force nice code standards ).  It is an e-commerce mobile friendly solution to get a small business selling online quickly and to provide a fast and extremely  user friendly experience for buyers and a happy and in-powering experience for software developers. I plan to change the name to Static-Back, as Static systems are Back and this is what this is!

The system connects to social network platforms by pulling in the clients YouTube videos and images from Facebook (FB).  So whenever they upload an image  to their  FB gallery or a video to their  Youtube playlist it will magically show in the video and image section on the App ; thus avoiding traditional  double maintenance  problems and having to have a bakend for the App.

The system avoids the use of a backend to reduce unnecessary complexity, there is no need for  Node code, php or a  database. Even though there is no backend, amazingly the user can still have their own online shop and  sell products. Currently it uses   Papaw , but other checkout gateways could be used.

Some key components are the pages, menu, routes  and product (including  unlimited product variations) that are dynamically generated from a single  JSON file. 

It uses Mobile friendly CSS styles to ensure it works on all mobile devices. 

The system can easily  be configured to get a small business up and running quickly and selling online.

There is a plan to build a CMS and a WYSIWUG system to allow the entire App solution to be created without writing a single line of code.
